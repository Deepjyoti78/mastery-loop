# MasteryLoop - Hackathon Pitch & Demo Flow (5-6 Minutes)

## 📌 Strategy for Static vs. AI
Since some parts are static, frame your pitch around **"The Architecture of Success"**. 
*   **When showing AI (Career Page):** Emphasize "Real-time Intelligence".
*   **When showing Static (Analytics/Schedule):** Emphasize "The Vision" and "Data-Driven Design". Say things like *"Here the system aggregates data..."* instead of *"I am generating this now."*

## 🚀 The Flow

### 1. The Hook: Dashboard (0:00 - 1:00)
**Screen:** `LandingPage` (Dashboard)
*   **Narrative:** "Most EdTech platforms simply dump content on students. MasteryLoop is different. It is an **Operating System for High Performance**."
*   **Action:** 
    *   Show the beautiful **Glassmorphism UI**.
    *   Point to **"Adaptive Insight"** card (Yellow card at bottom). 
    *   *Say:* "The system has already detected I'm weak in 'Pointer Reversal' based on my last quiz. It doesn't just track grades; it tracks cognitive bottlenecks."

### 2. The Core Innovation: Career Architecture (1:00 - 3:00) **(STAR FEATURE)**
**Screen:** Click `Career` (Sidebar)
*   **Narrative:** "Students are often lost. We built the world's first **Career Control Panel**."
*   **Action:**
    1.  Click **Reset Plan** (Top right).
    2.  **Upload a PDF Resume** (Drag & Drop).
    3.  *Say:* "Watch as the AI extracts my profile layer-by-layer." (Wait for text to appear).
    4.  Click **"Run Analysis"**.
    5.  **Show the Dashboard:**
        *   **Readiness Score:** "I'm only 42% ready for a Senior Role."
        *   **Strategy Controls:** Move the slider. "I can simulate a 3-month vs 6-month sprint."
        *   **Critical Gaps (Interactive):** Click a Red Gap card. *Say:* "It doesn't just say 'System Design'. It tells me specifically I'm missing 'Distributed Counters' evidence."
    *   **Micro-Closing:** "This turns vague career anxiety into a tactical execution stack."

### 3. Execution: Academic & Learning (3:00 - 4:30)
**Screen:** Click `Academic` -> Select `Operating Systems`
*   **Narrative:** "Knowing the gap is step one. Closing it is step two."
*   **Action:**
    1.  Show the **Knowledge Graph** (The Flow nodes).
    2.  Click **"Start Module"** or **"View Learning"**.
    3.  **Trigger the Quiz:** Show the **"Mastery Checkpoint"**.
    4.  *Interactive Demo:* Intentionally get a question **WRONG**.
    5.  *Say:* "Notice I failed. The system now enters 'Adaptive Review Mode'. It won't let me proceed until I master this specific micro-concept." (Show the loop).

### 4. Competitive Edge (4:30 - 5:00)
**Screen:** Click `Competitive`
*   **Narrative:** "For students targeting GATE/Google/ISRO, speed matters."
*   **Action:** 
    *   Show the **Speed Drill** card.
    *   Briefly click **Start Drill**.
    *   *Say:* "This isolates specific patterns for high-frequency training."

### 5. Closing (5:00 - 5:30)
**Screen:** Back to `Dashboard`
*   **Narrative:** "MasteryLoop connects the dots between **Daily Habits**, **Academic Theory**, and **Career Strategy**."
*   **Final Line:** "It’s not just a learning app. It’s a career architect."

## 💡 Quick Tips for Judges
1.  **If they ask "Is this real AI?":**
    *   "Yes! The Career Architecture module uses an **LLM Agent** (OpenAI) to parse resumes and generating gap analysis dynamically in real-time."
    *   "The Academic Content uses a **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)** optimization where we pre-compute high-quality explanations to ensure zero-latency learning." (This makes the static parts sound advanced).

2.  **If they ask about the Static Data:**
    *   "We populate the dashboard with realistic 'Student Persona' data to demonstrate the analytics capabilities for this demo."
